#### Binding Rules
- Referencing environment (RE)
- additional issue when/if a subroutine is either
      - passed as argument
      - returned as a result
      - stored into a variable
    - and then called

`g(5, f(3)); //crossed out`


`g(5,f);`

#### Shallow vs Deep Binding
When calling the function:
  - use Referencing environment form the moment of function call (shallow binding)
  - use Referencing environment from the moment when the function was ____ (deep binding)
    - passed,
    - returned,
    - stored.
```
procedure C
<!-- ----------- -->
procedure A(P:procedure, i:int)
  procedure B
    write(i)
  // body of A
  if i = 1 then
    A(B,2);
  else P;

// main
A(C,1);
```

##### Great Example:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1753186/dynamic-scoping-deep-binding-vs-shallow-binding

#### Implementation:
In order to generate shallow binding:
* No extra Implementation:

In order to generate deep binding:
* You need to encapsulate the RE of the parent function to the child function.
* Save the RE from the moment of function [pass|return|store] as a:

Define: closure:
* the RE + the function at the moment of function [pass|return|store].

Question:\
_Which one is better for the programmer?_\
Deep binding behaves more like you would expects.
_but shallow binding is easier to implement_

### Symbol tables
Problem: we want to access names & information about them.
(given a name we want to learn certain information about it.)

- static scoping
  - symbol table
- dynamic scoping
  - association list or
  - central reference table

#### Symbol Table (static)
- implemented as a dictionary
- operations
  - insert
  - lookup (locate)
- *how to handle nested scopes?*
  - a local def. hides (temporarily) a global one w/ the same name

#### LeBlanc-Cook Symbol Table
- implementation has both
  - a dictionary
  - a stack of active scopes
- when a new scope is encountered
> during compilation

- assign a label to it
- push the label on stack of active scopes
- when a decide is encountered:
    - insert the name + info in dictionary, together with label of critical scope.
- when a name is referenced ** *this is the step in example&fig. 4*
  - lookup for the name (in the dictionary) that has the label of the current or outer scopes. (look here, then in the outside onion layer, then outside onion layer...)
- when leaving a scope:
  - pop the scope label off the stack
  - removing entries from dictionary is unnecessary (can't get to entries without link anyway)


Ex:
```
x: read
i: int
procedure P
  i: int
  i = 4  // <- compiler is here in figure

//main
  i = 3
```

#### Association lists (for dynamic scoping languages)

The most recent active binding of a name is the one used.
##### implementation: (using a stack)
  - stack of pairs [name:information]
  - when a deceleration is encountered (at runtime)
    - push this pair on stack
  - when a name is referenced,
    - look in stack (top-down) for an entry pair with matching name
      - if in the stack, it is *active*
      - if found in the stack, it is the *first* found in stack
  - when leaving a scope
    - pop all local bindings from the stack

```
a:int
procedure first
  a = 1
procedure second
  a : int
  first()
//main

a = 2       // uses global a
second()    // uses global procedure
write(a)    // uses global a
```
![fig 5](figures/20200225-fig5.jpg)<p>

Problem:
if a name has been declared long ago,
- it is going to be very deep in the stack
- and retrieving that variable could take O(n<sup>ðŸ’©</sup>)

#### Central Reference Table approach

## cleanup before next section:
Four examples that do not fit into this model:
  * Overloading
  * Coercions
  * Polymorphism
  * Generics

#### Overloading

* Functions with the same name, but different in number of params, types of args.

Ex:
```
//  + addition int, float versions exist
```

#### Coercion
the process of automatic conversion
* automatic conversion from type A to type B.
  - When type B is expected but type A is provided.

The conversion (from float to int) below is silent and automatic.
```C
void f (float x)
  {...}
f(5);

<!-- each language has its own set of valid Coercions -->
```

#### Polymorphism
Generalism
Ex: sorting function -> only needs to know that its inputs implement comparitor

#### Generics
- Templates
  - Ex:
      ```C
      template <class T, int N> class Foo
      {
        T buffer[N];
      }

      Foo <char, 100> a;
      ```
